It has a lot of graphic scenes, but the interactions between the characters were sometimes very uncomfortable, in a realistic way.

It's just filled with so much noise.<br/><br/>First of all the book is not about creativity, it's about self-help and understanding yourself. The author goes through a process that is similar to how some forms of therapy are conducted, focusing on problem solving issues like childhood trauma, dealing with different negative emotions, and how to build a healthy social life around you. It's just all dumbed down and filled with internet and gaming memes, monologues,  and sections where the author wants you to write something. If I want to write I have a journal I write in, I bought a book to read it.<br/><br/>Many people will like the book, and if you dont mind books with a lot of 'energy' in them and you're struggling with emotional issues and not sure what to do, then go ahead and read the book. <br/><br/>If you're looking for anything about creative work or something more structured and to the point then look somewhere else.

Interests arise from experimentation in life, and they're not set and can change with time. Follow them and delve into different areas. Delving into different fields or hobbies or careers, i.e. being a generalist, can have more benefits than sticking to one thing your whole life.<br/><br/>The book is a slog though. It's a Gladwell type of book, a book told through the eyes of an investigative journalist, where the author jumps from one story to another all the time, and depending on your knowledge, experiences and interests, some stories can feel extremely boring, while other stories can feel very interesting.
